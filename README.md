Often, when I emailed professors, they took several days to respond to a simple question. That’s why our group developed an app called Rush. It’s a direct messaging app for students and professors, designed as an alternative to email. This app, similar to Slack or Teams, is specifically targeted at students and teachers. We created the app using Android Studio in Java. User data and messages are stored in Firebase, and messages are updated in real time.
